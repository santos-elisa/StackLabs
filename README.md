# **Stack Labs**

**Stack Labs** is a collaborative initiative to help Data Science and Engineering students to build a portfolio, turning the knowledge obtained in the trainings into value for businesses.

In this edition (2021-2022), around 100 students divided into about 20 squads were challenged to develop a **Data Science project**. Participants received feedback to improve their critical skills in **Analytics, Data Science, Data Engineering and Storytelling**.

[Olist](https://olist.com/pt-br) is a Brazilian Unicorn that offers e-commerce solutions for small and midsize businesses in Brazil.

**Stack Labs** are promoted by [Stack Tecnologias](https://stacktecnologias.com.br).
